# About

[ADAO](https://theadao.io) is a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) operating on the Cardano blockchain. By embodying the mantra of “Decentralization Together,” we hope to kindle imaginations and provide the framework and other resources for ideas to become the basis for separate autonomous entities all united by a common thread – decentralization. Community members will achieve this by voting to enact new policies and choose which best practices to adopt, from governance to funding. We are not constrained by legacy systems, but we are aided by a vision of a better future, allowing us to be agile and adaptive in our approach, seeking out solutions that can lead us to shared greatness.
